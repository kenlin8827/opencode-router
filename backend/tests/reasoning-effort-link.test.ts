/**
 * These tests prove the contract that the orchestrator relies on:
 * after a reasoning-effort downgrade, the value written back onto
 * normalizedRequest.reasoning_effort is what the provider payload
 * builder sees — and the builder produces an upstream payload that
 * matches the DOWNGRADED level, not the original client request.
 *
 * The orchestrator's post-execution recompute (which may further
 * downgrade against the actually-served model) is tested separately
 * in reasoning-effort-e2e.test.ts.
