/**
 * Throttled warn: console.warn with two layers of noise control.
 *
 * 1. Dedup: an identical `key` triple is only printed ONCE per process
 *    lifetime. The "repeat" counter is folded into the first line so
 *    operators still see that the condition is recurring — just not on
 *    every single request.
 * 2. Rate limit: even when keys differ, total warns per rolling window
 *    (default 60s) are capped (default 50). Beyond the cap we emit one
 *    summary line per window instead of N individual ones, with the
 *    suppressed count.
 *
 * Designed for the orchestrator hot path: every request may produce up
 * to two warn events (model lacks effort support; effort downgraded).
 * Without throttling, a misconfigured pool that always downgrades would
 * flood stderr at inference QPS.
 *
 * The class is process-scoped (singleton). Tests that need to assert
 * specific warn counts should construct their own instance via
 * `new WarnThrottle({ ... })`.
