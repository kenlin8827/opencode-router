/**
 * One captured turn — a single JSONL line in the per-session archive file.
 * `request` is the PRE-compression snapshot (what the client actually sent);
 * `response` is the full upstream payload. Either becomes a plain string with
 * `truncated: true` when it exceeds the per-body byte budget (a truncated
 * JSON document is no longer valid JSON, so it is stored as a string).
 * Request headers are NEVER captured (they carry API keys).
 *
 * `upstreamRequest` is the REAL outbound wire body the provider actually
 * sent — translated through the wire (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / Responses
 * / OpenCode-proxy), with `model.upstreamModel` substituted and routing-only
 * fields (`router_options`, `stream_options`) stripped. Shape varies by
 * wire (see provider adapter payload builders).
 *
 * `upstreamHttp` is the HTTP-level observation of the SUCCESSFUL outbound
 * call (last-write-wins across in-place retries and failover hops): the
 * resolved URL, HTTP status, a SAFE subset of response headers
 * (retry-after / request-id / content-type / ratelimit trio), TTFB, total
 * duration, and the wire kind. Header capture excludes all credential-
 * bearing fields.
 *
 * `inboundHttp` is the symmetric inbound leg: the Fastify-observed method,
 * URL, client IP, the final response status the gateway returned, total
 * gateway-side latency, a SAFE subset of response headers (content-type +
 * X-OCR-* diagnostics — never Authorization / cookies / API keys), and a
 * SAFE whitelist of inbound request headers (user-agent / accept-language /
 * request-id / anthropic-version / openai-organization). All credential-
 * bearing fields are dropped.
 *
 * `outboundHttp` is the gateway → client response observation: status,
 * total request lifecycle latency (the user's perceived response time),
 * and content-type. Pairs with `inboundHttp` to bookend the whole request.

/**
 * One HTTP-exchange event in the capture event stream. Replaces the
 * turn-centric `CaptureRecord` model: every HTTP exchange now emits TWO
 * independent events (request + response) instead of one combined record.
 *
 * Benefits over the turn model:
 *   - **Request events persist even when no response arrives** (timeout,
 *     client cancel, provider unreachable) — the request side is captured
 *     synchronously before the wire call returns, so failure is recorded.
 *   - **Request / response timing** becomes a first-class pair. Two events
 *     with the same `spanId` describe one exchange; their `ts`
 *     delta IS the request→response latency, computed at read time.
 *   - **Symmetry across client and upstream legs**: each direction emits
 *     its own request + response event, all four sharing one
 *     `traceId` so the full picture joins back together.
 *
 * A single inference turn produces 2-4 events sharing the same
 * `traceId`: client-request, gateway-response, upstream-request,
 * upstream-response. File layout keeps the per-turn grouping (same
 * `sessionId`) so the existing turn-based session browser keeps working
 * while the events are now individually retrievable.
 *
 * Direction naming follows the gateway's POV:
 *   - `client`     = client ↔ gateway (the request that arrived, the response
 *                    that was sent back to the client)
 *   - `upstream`   = gateway ↔ upstream provider (the request the gateway
 *                    sent upstream, the response that came back)
 * This matches OpenTelemetry conventions for proxy/gateway roles.
